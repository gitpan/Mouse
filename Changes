Revision history for Mouse

0.08 Sun Sep 28 12:46:07 2008
    * ALL dependencies have been removed!

    * Fixes for Class::Method::Modifiers being required for testing

0.07 Sun Sep 28 00:19:07 2008
    * All runtime dependencies have been removed! The only change in
      functionality (hopefully) is that the Sub::Exporter features can no
      longer be used (we've backed down to regular Exporter). Scalar::Util is
      required for "weaken" support, and Class::Method::Modifiers is required
      for method modifier support, but only if you use these features!
      Having Scalar::Util and MRO::Compat installed will provide only
      performance increases.

    * Tests and fixes for extending a Mouse class with Moose (nothingmuch)

    * Support for adding method modifiers to a role, and composing them into
      classes (we'll get true methods some day)

    * Method modifiers now go through the metaclass instead of invoking
      Class::Method::Modifiers directly

    * Remove the deprecated before/after/around triggers

    * Roles keywords 'requires' and 'excludes' now throw errors instead of
      silently doing nothing (they aren't implemented yet)

0.06 Thu Jul 23 02:10:07 2008
    * Deprecating before/after/around triggers! Switch back to coderef +
      whatever you used to do. Moose is have it implemented it as an extension
      trait.

    * Mouse
      - updated trigger doc (thanks perigrin)
        - which will not see CPAN :( sorry perigrin!

    * Mouse::Meta::Class
      - add a make_immutable method which does nothing(!), for even more
        Moose compat (nothingmuch's idea)

0.05 Thu Jul 17 01:53:20 2008
    * Mouse::Role
      Mouse::Meta::Role
      Mouse
      Squirrel::Role
      - Begin adding roles! Attributes are mostly there. Still experimental.

    * Mouse::Meta::Class
      Mouse::Object
      - Add clone_object and clone_instance (nothingmuch)

    * Mouse::Object
      - Add BUILDARGS (nothingmuch)

    * Mouse::Meta::Attribute
      Mouse::Object
      - Add "before" and "around" triggers. Moose doesn't even have them yet! :)

    * Everywhere
      - Improvements to the MOP (e.g. Class->add_method)

    * (build)
      - Excise dependency on Test::Warn, we only used it in one simple test

0.04 Tue Jun 17 04:56:36 2008
    * Mouse
      Mouse::Meta::Attribute
      - Add support for has '+name'
      - Add lazy_build (nothingmuch)

0.03 Thu Jun 12 21:54:07 2008
    * Mouse
      - Add before/after/around, courtesy of Class::Method::Modifiers

    * Mouse::Object
      - Add support for ->new({...})
      - Use compute_all_applicable_attributes in the constructor to get the
        attributes of superclasses
      - Add better support for undef init_arg

    * Mouse::Meta::Class
      - More methods: compute_all_applicable_attributes, has_attribute

0.02 Wed Jun 11 01:56:44 2008
    * Squirrel
      - Add Squirrel which acts as Moose if it's already loaded, otherwise
        Mouse (thanks nothingmuch)

    * Mouse::Meta::Object
      - Fix the order in which BUILD methods are called (thanks Robert
        Boone)
